  Doing create-react-app the right way while building up a project built to
  scale. Stub out functionality with usable verifiably working examples to
  better understand the value of each build tool, and to standardize a
  reproducible working procedure for others.

This was to allow myself to run through a proper best react environment setup, taking the appropriate time to follow the optimal path to building up a react development development base, to document a solid flow of how and what to build into the project, like many large boilerplates, but to do so in a way to gain insight into the importance of each build tool and package used. The results so far are satisfying. For example, getting a debugging configuration just right for VSCode according by Create React App documentation. That as opposed to stringing together an externally prescribed solution. One of the highlights was getting all of the intended (some being little known) debugging features up and running. I know some will be bringing me much greater peace of mind. Getting all of this in place and documenting it has been beneficial on a number of different levels. Further documentation of the process to come.
